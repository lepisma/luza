#+TITLE: luza

Learn to play board games by letting a machine learn to play board games and
/telling/ me good enough (and easy to follow) heuristics.

As of now I am using Azul as the test case for this. A set of abstractions will
follow that will allow other games to be used later.

* Azul
To start with, we will make a value estimator that works from game snapshot and
then tell the value of each player's state.  Since the game is not very deep and
greedy is not a super bad strategy, we might be able to approximate this cheaply
by simple beam traversal up to a certain depth.

As of now, there is a working game simulator where n players can play. There are
implementations for random, greedy, and heavy-playout MCTS players in the repo
at the moment. You can run this using something like ~env RUST_LOG=debug cargo
run~.
