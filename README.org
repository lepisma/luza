Learn to play board games by letting a machine learn to play board games.

To start with, I want to make a value estimator that works from game snapshot
and then tell the value of each player's state.

This firstly needs an image to state mapper which will be using LLM APIs. Then
we need to estimate the value of state which is the estimate of the score one
will get over a random set of runs.
